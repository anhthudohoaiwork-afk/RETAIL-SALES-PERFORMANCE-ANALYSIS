## 📊 Business Performance Overview (2016–2020)  

### 🔹 By Time (Yearly & Quarterly)  

![Revenue Over Time](images/revenue%20overtime.png)  

**Insights:**  
- **Revenue peaked in 2019 ($1,344,223)**, but *YoY growth rate declined from 2017–2019*.  
- **Data gap**: Trend chart (2016–2020) does not fully reflect 2016 & 2020 since dataset covers only *Q2-2016 → Q2-2020*.  
- Despite revenue fluctuations, **transactions and units sold increased steadily** → *long-term demand remained strong*.  

**Quarterly trends:**  

![Quarterly Revenue & YoY Growth](images/quarterly%20revenue%20%26%20YoY%20.png) 

**Insights:**  
- **Q2–2016 → Q4–2016**: Revenue rose from *16,530 → 75,434*, but dropped sharply in **Q1–2017 (51,709)**.  
  - Discounts were applied (0.69%) but ineffective, mostly targeting *Low Group customers* while discount range stayed at **Top Range**.  
- **Q1–2018**: Revenue fell by >50% vs Q4–2017 → *ineffective promotions*.  
- **Late 2018 – early 2019**: Another **53.5% decline**, partly due to *early COVID-19 impact & weak discount strategy*.  
- **Q1–2020 → Q2–2020**: Steepest revenue drop during **COVID-19 crisis**; business reacted too slowly (*still operating in “High” discount range*).

## 🏷️ By Product & Category 

![Top 10 Revenue by Product](images/top%2010%20revenue%20by%20product.png)  

**Insights:**  
- **Top 10 products** (knives, wallets, gloves, coats, cars, desktops, etc.) are spread across *multiple categories* → not concentrated in a single one.

![Revenue by Category](images/revenue%20by%20category.png)  

- **Revenue is distributed evenly across 4 categories**, with **Widget leading (28.1%)**.  
  - Widget shows **low sensitivity to discount**, making it *more resilient*.  
  - Other categories’ revenue is **discount-driven**.
 
  ## 🌍 By Geo-Locations

![Revenue by Geo-Locations](images/revenue%20by%20geo%20.png)  

**Insights:**  
- **Revenue distribution is balanced**, no extreme outliers.  
- **Top 10 cities** range between *$9,943 – $12,493*.  
- **City-level patterns differ:**  
  - **Petersville, AK**: AOV = $1,706, revenue = $3,413 → very few high-value orders.  
  - **Troy, ID**: AOV = $624, revenue = $2,498 → similar case.  
  - **Tunnelton, WV**: AOV = $824, revenue = $11,545.  
  - **Abilene, KS**: AOV = $642, revenue = $10,278.  

**Implications:**  
- **High AOV ≠ High Revenue** → some regions rely on a handful of large-ticket purchases → unsustainable.  
- **Priority markets** = High AOV + stable revenue → more reliable growth opportunities.  
- **Niche luxury markets** (high AOV, low revenue) → potential for experimentation but *not for scale*.  


## 👥 By Customer Source  

![Revenue by Customer Source](images/revenue%20by%20customer%20source.png) 

**Insights:**  
- **Revenue contribution is evenly distributed across channels**, with no single source dominating.  
- **Google Search** delivers slightly higher revenue → strong match between *search intent* and **product categories** (household & personal items).  
- **Affiliate** shows relatively lower performance but remains close to other channels → *untapped potential*.  

**Implications:**  
- A **balanced channel mix** reduces dependency risk.  
- **Google Search** demonstrates efficiency in capturing high-intent customers.  
- **Affiliate lags** behind but could be optimized to improve performance.  

## 🔄 Customer Retention & Discount Impact  

![Optimal Discount Range](images/optimal%20discount%20range.png)  

![Discount Impact](images/discount%20impact.png)  

**Insights:**  
- **Low Group** = *price-sensitive*, responds to discounts but delivers **low AOV**.  
- **Medium–Top Groups** = less discount-sensitive, willing to spend more.  
- **Widget category** = least affected by discount levels.  
- **Optimal discount range** = **Medium** → correlated with **higher AOV**, especially for *Medium–Top Groups*.  


## Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR) by Customer Group

![RPR](images/RPR.png)

### Group Insights
- **High Group**:  
  - RPR consistently ~51–57% (Q4-2018, Q3–Q4 2019).  
  - Stable, loyal, predictable revenue stream.  
  - **Priority**: Retention & upselling to maximize CLV.  

- **Top Group**:  
  - RPR fluctuates strongly (10–78%).  
  - High potential but unstable.  
  - **Strategy**: Personalized care (VIP perks, premium bundles).  

- **Medium Group**:  
  - RPR moderate (35–54%), largest customer base.  
  - **Strategy**: Scalable discounts; loyalty programs.  

- **Low Group**:  
  - RPR consistently <25%.  
  - Low value segment.  
  - **Strategy**: Allocate minimal budget, only test remarketing campaigns.  

---

### 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Revenue growth slowed before COVID, partly due to ineffective discounting.  
- High discounts did **not** guarantee higher AOV → **Medium discount levels drove more value**.  
- **High Group** customers = best segment (loyal + high spending).  
- **Top Group** = high upside but needs customized nurturing.  
- **Geo-expansion** should focus on regions with both high AOV & stable revenue, not just luxury niches.  
- **Google Search** remains the most scalable acquisition channel.  

# 📊 Recommendations
